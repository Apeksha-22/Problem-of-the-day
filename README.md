This repository contains my daily DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms) practice solutions, where I work on a new problem every day. The purpose of this repo is to document and share the solutions I work on as part of my daily coding routine.

I focus on solving a wide variety of problems ranging from basic to advanced topics in DSA, including arrays, strings, trees, graphs, dynamic programming, and more. Each solution is accompanied by an explanation of the approach used to solve the problem.

Each file contains:

The problem statement for the day.

The solution to the problem, including comments and explanations to clarify the approach.

I try to follow a consistent approach where I:

Understand the problem thoroughly.

Break it down into smaller sub-problems.

Implement the solution in the most efficient way possible.

This repo serves as a log of my daily progress and helps me track how my problem-solving abilities improve over time.
